I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics and Operations Research](http://stat-or.unc.edu/) at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](http://unc.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Yufeng Liu](https://yfliu.web.unc.edu/) and Professor [Will Wei Sun](https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~sun244/). Prior to UNC, I received a B.S. in Statistics From Seoul National University. Here is my [CV](./cv/CV%20.pdf)

I am currently the organizer of Professor Liu's group meeting website. In the group meeting, the group members present on their research progress or interesting recent papers. Please take a look at the [list of presentations]({{ site.url }}/group_meeting/2023Spring) in the current semester if you are interested.
