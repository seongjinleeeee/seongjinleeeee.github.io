I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Statistics and Operations Research](http://stat-or.unc.edu/) at [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](http://unc.edu/), under the supervision of Professor [Yufeng Liu](https://yfliu.web.unc.edu/) and Professor [Shankar Bhamidi](https://shankarbhamidi.web.unc.edu/). Prior to UNC, I received a B.S. in Statistics From Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China in 2018. 

I am currently the organizer of Professor Liu's group meeting website. In the group meeting, the group members present on their research progress or interesting recent papers. Please take a look at the [list of presentations]({{ site.url }}/group_meeting/2023Spring) in the current semester if you are interested.
